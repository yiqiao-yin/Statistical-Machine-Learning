# Example of Machine Learning Story

**Brief** To become a good machine learning practitioner, simply finishing school work is not enough. I recommend you find a topic you truly love and try to adopt theoretical framework to that topic. 

Take myself for an examle, I love looking at stock charts. When I was a child, my dad would discuss [Security Analysis](https://www.amazon.com/Security-Analysis-Foreword-Buffett-Editions/dp/0071592539) with me instead of Bible. I grew up with the passion of loving stock market and it is part of my identity. Later I started going to school and I found myself a unique ability is to relate almost all mathematical theorem with stock market. I test them out with real money. Of course I made mistakes and lost money before. I record the action and decision making process. I come back to computer and simulate the event again and again to myself until I figure out something right. Then I use real money again. This cycle repeated since 2010 and I pocketed a unique pool of experience no one has done before in capital market. Nobody pays me anything and I don't get high grades from this. I do this because I truly like it. I don't need other incentives. 

## Journey

First, I started by looking at correlation. This links to running regression and I have conducted experiment to learn that myself when I was a freshman. What is the linear relationship between market return and a stock return? How about fundamental values? 
- Paper is [How to Understand Future Returns of a Security](https://yiqiaoyin.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/how-to-understand-future-returns-of-a-securityef80a5-revised-2014.pdf).

Next, I started to size up. A data composed of stock-to-market comparison seemed too easy, so I started looking at cross-sectional finance data. The common data set that is used for PhD students in finance is CRSP stock universe. This is where I started to work with large-scale matrices that are 2GB in size and when I learned to work with different forms of data frames. It started to turn into tedious data clean-up work. However, the results are interesting. 
- I wrote [Cross-section Study on Stock Returns](https://yiqiaoyin.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/cross-section-study-on-stock-returns-to-future-expectation-theorem.pdf); and 
- Another similar project that examines stock market through market value balance sheet, click [here](https://yiqiaoyin.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/alternative-empirical-study-on-market-value-balance-sheet.pdf) if interested.

After looking at tons of stock returns data set, I got bored at conventional way of analyzing stock market. I invented this term "greed" so that I can turn this into a supervised model for myself to study. This is not publishable idea, but quite interesting to me. 
- Paper is [here](https://yiqiaoyin.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/empirical-study-on-greed.pdf). 

In 2016 I took a little diregression to study macro-economics. I did a project on contact rate in game theory. The paper was too hard, but the coding part is easy. I got stuck on dynamic model in macro material and it took me 3 months to figure this out. It leads to nowhere, but I am grateful to the professor who instructed me and him spending time with me on this project. 
- Trade Dyamics with Endogenous Contact Rate is [here](https://yiqiaoyin.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/trade-dynamics-with-endogenous-contact-rate.pdf). 

After trading floor, I took a little bit of time and summarizing my experiences on the trading floor and they become the following series of papers:
- [Buy Signal from Limit Theorem](https://yiqiaoyin.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/buy-signal-from-limit-theorem.pdf)
- [Time Series Analysis on Stock Returns](https://yiqiaoyin.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/time-series-analysis-on-stock-returns.pdf)
- [Martingale to Optimal Trading](https://yiqiaoyin.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/martingale-to-optimal-trading.pdf)
- [Anomaly Correction by Trading Frequency](https://yiqiaoyin.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/anomaly-correction-by-trading-frequency.pdf)
- [Absolute Alpha with Moving Averages: A Consistent Trading Strategy](https://yiqiaoyin.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/absolute-alpha-with-moving-averages.pdf)
- [Absolute Alpha with Limited Leverage](https://yiqiaoyin.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/absolute-alpha-with-limited-leverage.pdf)
- [Absolute Alpha by Beta Manipulation](https://yiqiaoyin.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/absolute-alpha-by-beta-manipulation.pdf)
and this when I started to build up intra-discplinary experience across the fields of (1) trading, (2) probability theory, (3) accounting, and (4) game theory. Most of what I am right now depend on these past couple of papers.

Interesting phenomenon (and you probably saw it too) was that I did not have any machine learning technique discussed yet. However, the few papers above gave me a unique view so that I can create any stock data however I want. This is when machine learning comes in, which leads to this paper.
- [Robust Portfolio by Influence Measure with presentation](https://yiqiaoyin.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/rubust-portfolio-by-influence-measure-yiqiao-yin-2018.pdf)
- A small project that comes along this paper is finished as [an Applied Data Science project](https://github.com/yiqiao-yin/Fall2018-Advanced-Data-Science-Final-Project)

I am now equipped with two unique skills: (1) I can use probability theory to manipulate and invent any stock data helpful for me; and (2) I can invent a machine learning algorithm that solves that problem. All of these ideas are updated frequently [here](https://yinscapital.com/private-collection/).
